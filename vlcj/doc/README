VLCJ provides a Java binding, using JNA, to the VideoLAN native media player.

It was inspired by, and is in part derived from, the JVLC bindings which seem 
to be no longer available, or at least not actively maintained.

Along with the native bindings, a basic media player class is included in the
distribution as is a simple test harness to launch it.

There are a very small number of relevant files in the distribution so it 
should be very easy to work out what is happening.

Make sure you read and understand the README.LICENSE file. VLCJ, JVLC and VLC
itself all use open source licenses. You must respect the terms of the GPL 3
license.

I'd be happy to hear about any interesting uses you may put this to!
