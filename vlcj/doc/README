VLCJ provides a Java binding, using JNA, to the VideoLAN native media player.

It was inspired by, and in part derived from, the JVLC bindings which seem to be no longer available.

Along with the native bindings, a basic media player class is included in the distribution as is a simple test harness to launch it.

There are a very small number of relevant files in the distribution so it should be very easy to work out what is happening.

Make sure you read and understand the README.LICENSE file.

I'd be happy to hear about any interesting uses you may put this to!
