These bindings are for version 1.1.x of libvlc.

Bindings exist for the core player functionality, the media player, events,
logos and marquees.

Some of the bindings, particularly with regard to structures, may not (yet) be
complete. There may well be bugs in the JNA mappings. My intention is to keep
improving this but it's a big job to get 100% complete and correct bindings!

There should be enough here to get a good media player working, have a look at
the TestPlayer class to help you get started.

I am happy to hear feed-back if there's something critical that the bindings
are not providing for you.

One significant difference is that there are now multiple methods available to
set the video surface - and this depends on the OS you are running under.

For this reason, you will need to determine which OS you are running on at
run-time and instantiate an appropriate player instance.

The only version I provide (at the moment) out of the box is for Linux.

I can not test these bindings on a Windows or Mac environment, so either send
me patches if you get it working on those environments, or just roll your own 
solution.

You will need to agree to assign me the copyright to your patch if you want it
included in the code-base.
